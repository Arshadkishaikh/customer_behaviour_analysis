## Project Workflow / Steps

### 1. Data Loading

* Imported the dataset into Python using Pandas.
* Verified schema, data types, and initial structure.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

* Analyzed data distribution, missing values, and outliers.
* Visualized trends and relationships between key variables.
* Identified data quality issues requiring cleaning.

### 3. Data Cleaning

* Handled missing values using appropriate statistical techniques.
* Corrected data types and removed inconsistencies.
* Prepared a clean dataset for downstream analysis.

### 4. SQL Analysis (PostgreSQL)

* Loaded the cleaned dataset into PostgreSQL.
* Wrote SQL queries to:

  * Aggregate key metrics
  * Perform group-wise analysis
  * Extract business insights efficiently

### 5. Dashboard (Power BI)

* Built an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

  * Key performance indicators (KPIs)
  * Trends and comparisons
  * Summary insights for stakeholders

### 6. Presentation (Gamma)

* Created a concise presentation highlighting:

  * Problem statement
  * Methodology
  * Key insights
  * Business recommendations

## Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard provides:

* Clear KPIs for quick decision-making
* Interactive filters for deeper analysis
* Clean, business-oriented visual design

---

## Results & Insights

* Identified meaningful trends and patterns in the data.
* Converted raw data into actionable insights.
* Delivered results in both visual (dashboard) and presentation formats for non-technical stakeholders.

   pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn sqlalchemy psycopg2
   ```

3. **Run the Jupyter Notebook**

   * Open the notebook and execute cells in order.

4. **Set up PostgreSQL**

   * Create a database
   * Update connection details in the script
   * Load the cleaned dataset

5. **Open Power BI**

   * Connect to PostgreSQL
   * Load the provided `.pbix` file or recreate visuals

6. **View the Presentation**

   * Open the Gamma-generated PPT for a summarized walkthrough
